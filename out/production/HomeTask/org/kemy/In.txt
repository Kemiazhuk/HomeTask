I saat with the litaatle broken boaaady in my hands, and tears came to my eyes. I didn't want to kill him. I only wanted to have him with me. And as I sat, the two redpolls perched on my shoulder and whispered some words that I did not understand. But they had a message, and I went at once to fulfil their desire. I opened my window and gently put them outside. Feeling that they were free again, they flew with soft whispers away and away, up and up, until they disappeared in the distance toward the north that led to their home, â€” and left me in my lonely room with a dead shore lark in my hand.
The shore lark ran up and down the floor of the cage all day. The redpolls flew about and perched on a little horizontal bar which I made higher up in the cage. I fed them and studied their choice of food. I made a mixture for them which is called nightingale's food, and this together with canary seeds they ate and liked very much. It was a great joy for me to watch them.
Then I thought I could tame them more quickly if I spent more time with them. So I took the cage into my bed-room, and was very much pleased with my experiment. The redpolls soon learned to perch on my hand. Later I went a step further and let them fly freely about the room. They flew about, greatly excited, and at last one of them perched on my shoulder. I did not move. Then the other came, and soon I could feed them on my shoulder. They were the most lovable birds I ever knew. They learned to come when I called them, and flew about in my room all day.
Spring was near now. The redpolls' feathers shone brighter, but the lark ran still more wildly up and down, with his sad "cheep, cheep." I decided to give him the same freedom that the happy redpolls had. I opened the door of the cage and stepped aside.
